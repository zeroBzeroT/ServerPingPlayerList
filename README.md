---

player-list is a plugin for [BungeeCord](https://github.com/SpigotMC/BungeeCord). Even if I'm not convinced by [BungeeCord](https://github.com/SpigotMC/BungeeCord) I started this project back then. The plugin makes sure that the player list is displayed as so-called samples again. This feature is included in Vanilla Minecraft and Bukkit, Spigot & Paper by default, but the [BungeeCord Proxy](https://github.com/SpigotMC/BungeeCord) does not support this feature. Therefore, I have developed this plugin.

### Libraries used
* BungeeCord API (only compiled)
